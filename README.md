## Abstract
The current global climate change is expected to affect biodiversity negatively 
at all scales leading to mass biodiversity loss. Population level changes in 
allele frequencies provide species to innovate adaptation to changing climates 
and prevent extinction. This is often exhibited through speciesâ€™ adaptations to 
local environment and reflects their potential for future climate change 
resilience. However, detecting such environment associated alleles requires
whole genome sequencing of many populations and/or long running common garden 
experiments. This is however, far from being practical for species with long 
generation times. Here, in the present study, using exome capture sequences, 
we tested multiple methods to assess local adaptation and climate resilience in
Norway spruce and Siberian spruce. We show that local adaptation in conifers can
be detected through allele frequency variation, population level ecological 
preferences, and historical niche movement. Moreover, we integrated both genetic
and ecological information into genetic off-set predictive models to show that
hybridization plays a main role in expanding niche breath of the two conifer 
species and may allow both species to cope better with changing future climates.
Finally, this allowed us to identify genetically isolated populations at risk 
under current climate change.
